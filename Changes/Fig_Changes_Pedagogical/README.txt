This directory has the code for making the pedagogical figure introducing changes in synchrony.

To get the figure, set the working directory of R to this directory, and run the script
Fig_Changes_Pedagogical.R from a fresh R session. It is important to use a fresh R session as
some of the functions used have common names also used by other functions in other packages.
You may have to verify that the dependencies at the top of the file are available.
