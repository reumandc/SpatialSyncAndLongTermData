This folder has the code for making the figure showing the analysis of phytoplankton color
time series truncated to different lengths. 

To get the figure, set the working directory of matlab to this directory, and run the script
Fig_Timescale_Plankton.m. 

The data are downloaded automatically from https://doi.mba.ac.uk/data/3152, and they have doi
